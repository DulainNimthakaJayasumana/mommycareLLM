What is the definition of secondary postpartum haemorrhage?,Excessive bleeding from the birth canal occurring between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally.
What is the most common cause of secondary postpartum haemorrhage?,"Retained placental tissue, often accompanied by endometritis."
What is endometritis?,An infection of the uterine lining that can lead to uterine bleeding.
How does retained placental tissue lead to secondary PPH?,It prevents uterine involution and causes persistent bleeding.
What are the symptoms of secondary postpartum haemorrhage?,"Vaginal bleeding after the first 24 hours post-delivery, with or without pain or infection."
What investigation is commonly used to diagnose retained products of conception?,Pelvic ultrasound.
Why is ultrasound not definitive in diagnosing retained products?,It has a high false positive rate and echogenic material may be due to blood clots.
What is the first step in managing secondary PPH in a stable patient?,Starting a course of antibiotics.
What antibiotics are typically used for endometritis?,Cephalosporins or a combination of gentamicin and clindamycin.
When is surgical evacuation considered in secondary PPH?,If there is significant bleeding or suspicion of retained products not responding to antibiotics.
What are the risks associated with uterine evacuation?,Uterine perforation and intrauterine adhesions.
What is uterine artery embolization?,A procedure to occlude uterine arteries and control bleeding.
When is uterine artery embolization used?,In cases of persistent or recurrent bleeding despite other treatments.
What are arteriovenous malformations?,Abnormal vascular connections that can cause secondary PPH.
How are AVMs diagnosed?,Using CT angiography.
How are AVMs treated?,Usually with embolization rather than surgery.
What is the relevance of von Willebrand’s disease in secondary PPH?,It is a bleeding disorder that may cause delayed postpartum haemorrhage.
How is von Willebrand’s disease treated?,With desmopressin.
What is choriocarcinoma?,A malignant tumour from trophoblastic tissue causing secondary PPH.
How is choriocarcinoma diagnosed?,Through elevated serum hCG and imaging.
How is choriocarcinoma treated?,With chemotherapy.
How can anticoagulants like warfarin cause secondary PPH?,By increasing bleeding risk if levels are too high.
How is warfarin-induced bleeding treated?,By stopping warfarin and administering vitamin K.
What is a clinical sign of endometritis?,Foul-smelling vaginal discharge and uterine tenderness.
What is the role of broad-spectrum antibiotics in secondary PPH?,To treat infections such as endometritis.
What is the significance of uterine involution in postpartum recovery?,Failure of involution can indicate retained tissue or infection.
What should be done before performing uterine evacuation?,Confirm diagnosis and administer antibiotics.
What can mimic retained products on ultrasound?,Blood clots or postpartum changes.
What is a rare but serious cause of secondary PPH?,Choriocarcinoma.
Why is close follow-up important after uterine evacuation?,To monitor for recurrence and complications.
What symptoms indicate infection in secondary PPH?,"Fever, uterine tenderness, and foul discharge."
What is the timeframe for secondary PPH to occur?,Between 24 hours and 12 weeks after delivery.
Why might surgical evacuation be avoided initially?,Due to risks like uterine perforation.
What is a non-surgical option for controlling PPH?,Uterine artery embolization.
What role does hCG play in diagnosing choriocarcinoma?,Elevated hCG levels support the diagnosis.
What is Asherman’s syndrome?,Intrauterine adhesions that can follow surgical evacuation.
What is the purpose of CT angiography in PPH?,To detect vascular abnormalities like AVMs.
What causes uterine tenderness in endometritis?,Inflammation of the uterine lining.
How does desmopressin work in von Willebrand’s disease?,It increases von Willebrand factor levels.
What type of infection is endometritis?,A polymicrobial infection of the endometrial lining.
What is the benefit of embolization over surgery?,It preserves fertility and is less invasive.
What should clinicians be cautious of with ultrasound?,False positives for retained products.
What are signs that surgical evacuation may be needed?,Persistent heavy bleeding or non-response to antibiotics.
What is the role of hCG in gestational trophoblastic disease?,Used as a tumour marker for diagnosis and monitoring.
Why is clinical correlation important in diagnosis?,Because imaging alone may be misleading.
What should be done if bleeding recurs after treatment?,Re-evaluate for retained products or AVMs.
What medication is used to reverse warfarin effects?,Vitamin K.
What condition can result from uterine surgery?,Asherman’s syndrome.
What is a key clinical feature of AVM-related PPH?,Recurrent heavy bleeding not responding to usual treatments.
